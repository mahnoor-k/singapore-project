        <h3>Identity Cards</h3>
        <p>In 1941, as rumours of war grew louder, every civilian in Singapore was ordered to carry an identity card under new security laws. Officially, it was meant to catch spies but for many, the small card felt like a warning that war was coming closer.</p>

        <h3>Banana Notes</h3>
        <p>The Japanese-issued currency lost value overnight due to hyperinflation and a severe depreciation in the value of the banana note. This fueled a dangerous black market. </p>

        <img src="assets/rationcard.jpg" alt="Ration Card" />
        <h3>Ration Card</h3>
        <p>During the Japanese Occupation, food was scarce and strictly rationed. Locals queued for hours for rice, limited by ration cards. Many faced severe hunger, while others grew food or made substitutes to help their communities survive.</p>

        <h3>Japanese Textbookds</h3>
        <p>Schools were forced to teach Japanese using textbooks filled with new language and propaganda. These books became symbols of how daily life, and young minds, were reshaped under occupation.</p>

        <h3>Syonan Gaho Magazine</h3>
        <p>This Japanese magazine showed smiling locals to portray life under occupation as happy and prosperous. In truth, many faced hunger and fear. Such images were propaganda, hiding hardship behind an idealized facade.</p>

        <h3>Sook Ching Registration Stamp</h3>
        <p>Japanese feared Chinese resistance in Singapore. So, they ordered men to report for mass screenings called Sook Ching, meant to hunt out enemies. Many never returned. Those who survived got this stamp, a small mark that meant life. </p>

        <h3>Vaccination Certificate</h3>
        <p>To curb diseases like smallpox and typhus, the Japanese enforced compulsory vaccinations across Singapore. Civilians queued for injections and received certificates as proof. These small papers offered protection from illness but also reminded people how tightly daily life was controlled under occupation.</p>

        <h3>Japanese Purchasing Ticket</h3>
        <p>Under Japanese rule, purchasing tickets controlled what civilians could buy. This one, for a silk sari, shows how daily life blended culture, scarcity, and a barter economy.</p>
