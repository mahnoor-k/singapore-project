        <h3>“The Smell of Rice”</h3>
        <p class="voice-text">
          “Sometimes, we’d stand outside the kitchens just to smell rice cooking. Mama would hush us, worried that soldiers might see us loitering. We were always hungry. Always counting ration stamps, always praying for another handful of rice.”

        <p class="voice-text">
          “Papa came home whispering that Japanese soldiers searched the streets today. They say neighbors disappear. I hide my slate tablet under the floorboards. I keep writing because if I stop, maybe my thoughts will vanish too.”

        <p class="voice-text">
          “I once traded a gold ring for two sacks of rice. The man slipped banana notes into my hand, and I cried, knowing tomorrow they’d be worthless. Yet, the rice kept my children alive another week.”

        <p class="voice-text">
          “Every hammer tap echoes too loudly these days. Japanese officers come, ordering tables, chairs, signs in new words I cannot read. I build them, but I also carve messages into hidden panels. One day, people will find them.”
