    <h2>Why Surrendered Spaces?</h2>
    <p>
      <em>Surrendered Spaces</em> is a digital history project exploring the civilian experience during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore (1942–1945). While many historical accounts and exhibitions focus on military events and political figures, this project seeks to shine a light on the quieter aspects of wartime life—ordinary places, objects, and personal stories that shaped everyday survival.
    </p>

    <h2>My Approach</h2>
    <p>
      Inspired by course readings and field visits, I designed this website to explore elements of history that are sometimes less visible in public narratives. Each section—from the wartime map to object stories and personal voices—aims to honor civilian resilience and capture diverse perspectives from that period.
    </p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      Creating <em>Surrendered Spaces</em> has shown me how rich and layered history can be. Museums and archives do incredible work preserving significant events and artifacts. This project aims to complement those efforts by highlighting different components of civilian life and memory that also deserve attention.

      The website was manually coded in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. All source code is publicly available on my <a href="https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.
