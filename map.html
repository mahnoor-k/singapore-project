      <h2>Surrendered Spaces: Life Mapped During the Japanese Occupation</h2>
      <p>The Japanese wartime map of Singapore was a strategic military and administrative tool, detailing roads, railways, industrial zones, and renamed places under Japanese control. It reflects how the occupiers reimagined the island as “Syonan,” yet reveals little of the daily hardships, resistance, or human stories that unfolded. This digital map reclaims that space by overlaying key sites that reflect both the trauma and resilience of those who lived, fought, and survived during the Japanese Occupation.</p>

      <img src="assets/sime-road-camp.jpg" alt="Sime Road Camp" />
      <p>Following the Japanese invasion and British surrender in February 1942, Sime Road Camp was repurposed as a secondary internment camp, mainly for civilian detainees. It served as a backup to Changi Prison, with internees sometimes transferred between the two to manage overcrowding.</p>

      <img src="assets/changi-prison.png" alt="Changi Prison" />
      <p>During the Japanese occupation of Singapore, Changi Prison served as an internment camp for both prisoners of war and civilian detainees. Originally designed to hold around 600 inmates, the prison became severely overcrowded, at times housing more than 9,000 people. Conditions were extremely harsh, marked by overcrowding, limited supplies, and constant danger.</p>

      <img src="assets/japanese-school.png" alt="Syonan Nippon Gakuen (Syonan Japanese College)" />
      <p>To promote the learning of Japanese, the occupiers established dedicated language schools such as Syonan Nippon Gakuen in 1942. These schools enrolled students of various ages and backgrounds, requiring them to complete an intensive three-month course that taught the Japanese language along with the values and lifestyle promoted by the Japanese authorities.</p>

      <p>The Former Ford Factory in Bukit Timah was the site where the British formally surrendered Singapore to the Japanese on 15 February 1942. Originally an assembly plant for Ford vehicles, it was seized by the Japanese and repurposed as the headquarters for their military administration.</p>

      <img src="assets/bukit-chandu.jpeg" alt="Bukit Chandu" />
      <p>Bukit Chandu, also known as Opium Hill, was the site of a fierce final battle during the Japanese invasion in February 1942. It was here that soldiers from the Malay Regiment made a courageous last stand against overwhelming Japanese forces. Despite being outnumbered and poorly equipped, they fought to the end to defend Singapore.</p>
